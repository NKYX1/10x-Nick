        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am fluent in Chinese and work as an interpreter and translator, bridging communication between diverse teams and stakeholders. 
            In addition to my language expertise, I also serve as the head of the vehicle department at my company, overseeing operations, 
            logistics, and team management. My role demands a unique combination of linguistic precision and technical understanding, 
            and I take pride in delivering exceptional results in every aspect of my responsibilities.

            <h3>1<sup>st</sup> Project: Advanced Vehicle Components</h3>
            <p>
                One of my notable projects was negotiating a large-scale contract with a Chinese supplier for advanced vehicle components. 
                Acting as the lead interpreter during the negotiation, I ensured the accuracy of every term and condition discussed, 
                bridging language and cultural differences seamlessly. The deal was finalized successfully, resulting in a 30% reduction 
                in procurement costs and setting the foundation for a long-term partnership.

            <h3>2<sup>nd</sup> Project: Technical Training Program</h3>
            <p>
                In another project, I managed the localization of a technical training program designed for our fleet maintenance team. 
                I translated the materials from Chinese into English, adapting them for cultural and technical relevance, and conducted 
                live interpretation during hands-on training sessions. This initiative improved the efficiency of our team and led to 
                a significant reduction in vehicle downtime.

        <div class="project3">
            <h3>3<sup>rd</sup> Project: GPS Tracking System</h3>
            <p>
                A third successful endeavor was implementing a GPS tracking system across our vehicle fleet. 
                As the head of the vehicle department, I coordinated with the Chinese manufacturers, translated user manuals, 
                and led training sessions for the team. My linguistic expertise and technical oversight ensured the system’s smooth 
                integration, increasing fleet efficiency by 25%.
